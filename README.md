# Option Value Calculator

**Quantify the business value of AI-enabled parallel exploration.**

## The Idea

Traditional development forces premature commitment: pick one approach, invest heavily, discover late if it was wrong.

AI changes the economics. Now you can explore multiple approaches in parallel at minimal cost — and that optionality has measurable value.

This tool helps you:
- Understand real options theory applied to software development
- Calculate the option value of parallel exploration
- Make the business case for AI-augmented development
